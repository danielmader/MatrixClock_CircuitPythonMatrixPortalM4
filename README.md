# MatrixClock_CircuitPythonMatrixPortalM4

A simple clock for a 64x32 HUB75 LED matrix display powered by Adafruit's MatrixPortal M4 with NTP sync and a Sensirion SHT40 ambient sensor. 

This repo is a consolidated example.

# Hardware

## Adafruit MatrixPortal M4
I'm still using the original MatrixPortal (25,90€):

## RGB LED matrix 64x32
The display (23,95€) is from WaveShare (and was much cheaper than the similar product from Adafruit):

Here I've found very valuable information about how to use this kind of display:

## I²C temperature and pressure sensor
The sensor (7.95€) came on a convenient break-out board from Adafruit:
